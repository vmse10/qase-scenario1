# Qase Scenario 1 – Result Sync Tool

This repository contains a Python script that synchronizes automated test results
between two Qase projects using a shared "Automation Key" custom field.

You can choose which run to pull results from (by ID, title, or latest),
and which run to push them into in the target project.

Full README will be completed as part of the assignment.
